        <h1>Getting Started with AuthFlow Authenticator</h1>
        <p>Welcome to AuthFlow Authenticator! This guide will walk you through the steps to register an account and set up two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth setup process.</p>
        
        <h2>Step-by-Step Account Registration</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Download the App:</strong> Start by downloading the AuthFlow Authenticator app from your mobile device's app store.</li>
            <li><strong>Open the App:</strong> Once installed, open the app. You will be greeted with a welcome screen offering you the option to register or sign in.</li>
            <li><strong>Register:</strong> Tap on the "Register" button. You will need to provide a valid email address and create a strong password.</li>
            <li><strong>Verify Email:</strong> A verification email will be sent to the provided email address. Open this email and click on the verification link to continue.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Your Account:</strong> After email verification, you'll be prompted to set up two-factor authentication. Follow the in-app instructions to complete this crucial step.</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Once 2FA is set up, your registration is complete! You will be redirected to the dashboard where you can start adding accounts for 2FA protection.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Adding Accounts for 2FA</h2>
        <p>To add an account for two-factor authentication:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the app dashboard, tap the "Add Account" button.</li>
            <li>Enter the account details, including the service name and your username for that service.</li>
            <li>Scan the QR code provided by the service you wish to add, or manually enter the 2FA setup key.</li>
            <li>Once added, the app will generate a 6-digit code for that account. Use this code for 2FA verification when prompted by the service.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Deleting an Account from AuthFlow Authenticator</h2>
        <p>If you need to remove an account from AuthFlow Authenticator:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the app and navigate to the dashboard.</li>
            <li>Locate the account you wish to delete and swipe left (on iOS) or long-press (on Android) to reveal the delete option.</li>
            <li>Tap "Delete" and confirm your decision. The account will be removed from AuthFlow Authenticator.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <h3>Note:</h3>
            <p>Deleting an account from AuthFlow Authenticator does not disable 2FA for that service. You must disable 2FA from within the service's settings if you wish to remove this layer of security completely.</p>
